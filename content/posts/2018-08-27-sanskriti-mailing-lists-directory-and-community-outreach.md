Dear members of Sanskriti,

We understand that sometimes getting the word out to the membership can be challenging. We have taken a few steps to make this information exchange easier and making us more responsive. We would request that you please pass on this information to your friends and fellow members who either are not on our mailing list or who are having trouble staying in touch with our messages.

1. Please check out the updates on the Sanskriti website (http://www.sanskriti-dc.org ).
1. All Sanskriti- and NABC-related messages (not community announcements) that have been sent since August 1  are now archived on [this page](https://sanskritiannounce.netlify.com) . So even if you are having problems with our emails, you can stay up to date with our announcements.
1. We are in the process of updating the printed Sanskriti Directory for distribution at Durga Pujo. If you would like to update your current information, please let us know by August 31  using the link available on http://www.sanskriti-dc.org . You may also access this link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRHlQoZNHyJDHHjraWE4vMXe7yYwyA0MQ_EXW6JFLOvicWzQ/viewform) .
1. If you are having problems with receiving our e-mails, please see the note on http://www.sanskriti-dc.org . In particular, if you feel that your current e-mail is not part of our mailing list, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYWqXFUc_UGenZsLxF1h1vBvKKYe72pOk2ZFLk6UAs9Ll8_Q/viewform)  to let us know; we will verify that the e-mail is in our mailings lists by the following Sunday. If you still have trouble receiving our e-mails, please check your spam folders or other settings.
1. Please do check your spam folders intermittently. Due to the vagaries of e-mail providers, some (but not all) mail can be sent to spam on an apparently random basis. This has been our experience as well.

We look forward to continuing to serve you, and hope to see you at our [Picnic](http://sanskriti-dc.org/sanskriti-picnic-2018/)  in September and at [Durga Pujo](http://sanskriti-dc.org/durga-pujo-2018)  in October.

With regards,

Sanskriti BOD 2018
